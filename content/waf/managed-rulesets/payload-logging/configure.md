# Configure payload logging for a Managed Ruleset in the dashboard

Configure payload logging for a ruleset in the ruleset configuration page.

1.  Open **Firewall** > **WAF**.

2.  Click **Configure** next to the Managed Ruleset you want to configure.

3.  At the bottom of the page, click **Configure payload logging**.

4.  After reading and understanding the implications of enabling payload logging, select one of the available options:

    *   **Generate key pair using your web browser** — Generates a key pair (a private and a public key) in your browser and configures payload logging with the generated public key.

    *   **Use my own public key** — Enter a public key [generated by the `matched-data-cli` command-line tool](/managed-rulesets/payload-logging/command-line/generate-key-pair).

5.  Click **Next**.

6.  If you generated a key pair in the browser, copy the displayed private key and **store it safely**. You will use this private key later to [view the decrypted payload content](/managed-rulesets/payload-logging/view).

7.  Click **Done**.
